Rooibos gives a completely naturally caffeine-free infusion, which is why it is so great for the evening! Drunk as an infusion by the people of South Africa for the last 300 years, Rooibos has been cultivated and marketed since the 1930’s. Today it is the national drink of South Africa.',

This tea is not infused, but is whisked into water. This means the tea leaves are consumed, which explains the delicious flavour of Matcha Impérial as well as its many benefits. Matcha Impérial is a super-food with many qualities.\nRich in caffeine, with energising properties, and in theanine, which aids relaxation and concentration, one bowl of Matcha contains up to three times more catechin (a molecule with strong anti-oxidant properties) than any other green tea.',
